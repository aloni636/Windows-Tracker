# Windows Tracker
My personal way to track the evolution of my windows system.

Currently it keep track of **bookmarks** for Chrome, Edge and Firefox, and **installed programs** in the registry, Powershell gallery modules and Winget.

## Setup
Clone the repo, create a `config.psd1` based on `config.example.psd1`, and execute `.\setup.ps1`.
